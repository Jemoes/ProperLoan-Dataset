## by Joseph Etim


## Dataset

> The Prosper Loan data contains 113, 937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower's rate, current loan status, borrower's income and many others. This dataset can be downloaded on [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQmkX4iOT6Rcrin42vslquX2_wQCjIa_hbwD0xmxrERPSOJYDtpNc_3wwK_p9_KpOsfA6QVyEHdxxq7/pub) and the data dictionary is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0). 


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found out that the top Earning Occupation per month are Doctor, Attorney, Judge, Executive and Dentist. The least Earning Occupation are Students, Teacher, Waiter/Waitress, Nurses and Food Service. Also, I also looked at the top 20 cities with the most and least loan amount from borrowers and also looked at the relationship between borrowers income and repayment.

>  I also looked at the frequency of the term used amongst borrowers which showed that most borrowers opted for the 36 months term period. I could also see that the higher the recommendation rating the better the chance of loan completed status by the borrower.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I was able to show the relationship between borrowerâ€™s income and the repayment success as I was able to deduce that the Borrowers struggling with their loan are the Unemployed and the Borrowers earning between $1 - 24,999. Also, it can be seen from the chart that borrowers with high income ranges ask for high loan amounts. The borrowers that received the largest loan amounts are in the Current Loan Status and earn between $100,000 and more annually.
